# ðŸ“‰ Customer Churn Prediction using ANN (TensorFlow 2.0, Keras, Python)

This project builds an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) using TensorFlow 2.0 and Keras to predict **customer churn** in a telecom company.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview

Customer churn refers to the phenomenon where customers stop doing business with a company. Accurately predicting churn helps businesses retain their customers and improve service. In this project:

- I used the **Telco Customer Churn Dataset** from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn).
- I performed data preprocessing: handled missing values, encoded categorical variables, and scaled features.
- I built and trained a binary classification model using an ANN.
- I evaluated the model using **confusion matrix**, **classification report**, **precision**, **recall**, **F1 score**, and **accuracy**.

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pandas, NumPy
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow 2.0 / Keras
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## ðŸ§ª Dataset

ðŸ“¥ Download the dataset from Kaggle:  
**[Telco Customer Churn Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/blastchar/telco-customer-churn)**

After downloading, place `Telco-Customer-Churn.csv` inside the `dataset/` directory.

## Start the notebook:
jupyter notebook customer_churn_prediction.ipynb
